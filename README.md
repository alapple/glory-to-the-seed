# glory-to-the-seed

A communist farming and management simulator.

## 5-year-plan
You get a letter from the government, requesting a specific amount of potatoes by the end of the 5-year time period. 

## Management
You manage three acres/regions and hav to produce potatoes. While playing, random events can occur, which add different modifiers. Some are positive and some are negative. These modifiers can effect harvesting and happiness. At the start of every year you get a random amount of resources to deal with the bad modifiers. You might be undersupplied on resource, so you need decide where to use them. 

## Mechanics
While playing, the player is able to move freely across his fields and plant his crops. 
While planting crops or taking care of your soil, you may find rare valuables dug in the soil. These can then be exchnaged for Rubbles.
With Rubbles players can employ employees, they can buy perks like quicker harvest speed, harvest machines.
Seasons that influence the crops viability. Some crops grow better in the cold, some in hot climates.
When buying items for the farm, you always have to think ahead due to the travel time of the delivery truck. The truck always arrives once a day.

Random Events:
Every now and then, a robber come could by and steal some of your harvest, to prevent this you could build a fence.
Insects can infest the harvest which then results in a loss of harvest. To prevent this you can buy pesticides to protect your crop.
A virus wave hits your farm and infects your workers, this results in a loss of efficiency for a period of time. To prevent this, you can buy medicine

## Report
After the 5 years, you have to submit the produced potatoes. If you produced enough, you win the game. But if you undersupplied the governmnet, you can be honest and risk being thrown into the gulag or fake the numbers and hope you don't get caught. But if the fake is detected, you are definitively thrown into the gulag for betraying the motherland.
