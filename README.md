# glory-to-the-seed

A communist farming and management simulator.

## 5-year-plan
You get a letter from the government, requesting a specific amount of potatoes by the end of the 5-year time period. 

## Management
You manage three acres/regions and hav to produce potatoes. While playing, random events can occur, which add different modifiers. Some are positive and some are negative. These modifiers can effect harvesting and happiness. At the start of every year you get a random amount of resources to deal with the bad modifiers. You might be undersupplied on resource, so you need decide where to use them. 


## Report
After the 5 years, you have to submit the produced potatoes. If you produced enough, you win the game. But if you undersupplied the governmnet, you can be honest and risk being thrown into the gulag or fake the numbers and hope you don't get caught. But if the fake is detected, you are definitively thrown into the gulag for betraying the motherland.
