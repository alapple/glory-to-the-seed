## Mechanics:
### Priority 1:
At the beginning of each year the player gets a random number of resources. He can freely use them on the fields or to influence peoples happiness.

At the end of the game, a report needs to be submitted. If you have produced too few crops, you can either be honest and risk getting thrown into the gulag or try to fake the numbers and get away with it. 
If the fake is detected, you are thrown directly into the gulag.

You have to manage the happiness of the people. The happier they are, the more crops they produce.

### Priority 2:
While planting crops or taking care of your soil, you may find rare valuables dug in the soil. With these valuables, you can bribe the inspector. 

### Priority 3:
Every year, you can choose from 3 random perks.

### Priority 4:
Seasons that influence the crops' viability. In the winter, crops grow slower.

## Random Events:
### Priority 1:
A fire can break out at your field. You have to use water to take the fire out.

Your people can get moody:
* If they are hungry you can supply them with food. This reduces the crops availiable for the report.
* If they start a revolt, you can either send the red army to violently shut down the protests, but this takes a while or you can spread propaganda, this is instant but doesn't work every time.
* If they get desperate, you can give them vodka to forget their problems.

Your machines can break down, and you have to expand spare parts to repair them.


### Priority 2:
A hungry neighbor can steal your crops. You can report him to the government to send him to the gulag. If you don't so this, happiness rises, but you have fewer crops

### Priority 3:
Capitalists disguised as insects can infest your farm. As pesticides are too expensive, you can send the KGB to remove them.

### Priority 4:
A virus wave hits your farm and infects your workers, this results in a loss of efficiency for a period of time. To prevent this, you can buy medicine
