# Glory-to-the-seed

## General Information
**Glory-to-the-seed** is a resource management game about production quotas, administrative pressure, and hunger. This means the player can´t move around. They are a soviet manager and sit in their office and manage the regions by making decisions like what resources to allocate to what region and depending on the resources they get at the beginning of each new year what problems (modifiers) to fix and which to leave. Regions consume a random amount of food.

## The Start
The first thing that happens in ever new game is the player gets a letter from the government requesting a specific amount of potatoes. The manager then gets Regions and has 5 years to produce the amount of potatoes requested. In those 5 years random events happen that add positive and negative modifiers to the regions.

## The Gameplay Loop
You get the letter specifying the amount of potatoes needed. Then you take a look at your regions and look at their modifiers (things like: damaged equipment, burning fields) and their happiness level. The higher the happiness level the higher the amount of potatoes produced. Now you look at what resources the state allocated to you. Depending on that you make strategic decisions on what modifiers to fix and which to ignore. There is **no** way to get more resources before the end of the year so you have to be strategic on where to use them and what to ignore. You have to be carful as modifiers can change throwout the year.

## The End
After the 5 years you have to report on how many potatoes you produced. If you meet the quote everything is fine and you win the game. If not you have 2 options either you are honest and report the real amount. If you do you have the risk of being thrown into the gulag if the difference is to high. The second option is to lie and hope the inspector does not notice. The higher the difference the higher the chance he notices. If he cates you you are thrown into the gulag. If not you won.

## The Goal
The player does not win by improving the regions or eliminating hunger. The goal is to meet the production quota at all costs. The system does not measure quality of life. Only production is evaluated.
