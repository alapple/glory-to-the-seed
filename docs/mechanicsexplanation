## Random Events

##NEGATIVE RANDOM EVENTS
•	A fire will destroy your farm if you let it burn for longer than 4 minutes, meaning you lose the game.
•	A fire shrinks your potatoes per second rate by 75% while it is active and 35% for 1 minute after it is put out.
•	Every 15 seconds a fire block is spawned, 1 fire block requires 1 water bucket to be put out. Meaning if you let the fire get too big, you would need 12 water buckets to put the fire out.
•	If a worker is moody, you can automatically regenerate their production rate them by giving them 20 of your potatoes.
•	If you don’t take care of your workers, you will lose 10% of the production rate per minute, meaning that after 10 minutes, you will stop producing any crops.
•	If your workers start revolting, you can contact the red army. They will take 7 days to arrive. Once completed, production rates would be down 30% for 1 week. If you don’t contact the red army, there is a possibility that 35% of your workers will leave on the 4th day.
•	If your machines break down, you need to find the tools in your soil. Once found, you can repair your machine and get back to work.
•	If a neighbor decides to steal your crops, you could lose between 20%-40% of your total harvest. If you report to him, you will get your potatoes back, but production rate of workers are lowered by 35%. If you don’t, workers remain the same, but you lose your potatoes.

##POSITIVE RANDOM EVENTS
•	Golden Soviet Rain! This rain is making your soil extremely fertile, meaning your production rate is 1.5x for the next 30 seconds.
•	Oh wow! Stalin came by to greet your fellow farmers. The are now extremely happy and their production rate has increased by 2x for the next 45 seconds.
•   The government is starting to tear apart some old military vehicles. The scrap is being gifted to farmers to help assist their potato harvest. You have now gained between 2-5 scrap.






## Production Rates
•	Workers with 100% production rate will double your harvest. Meaning if you have a harvest of 5 potatoes/second, you will now have 10 potatoes/second.
•	0% production rate means your workers are not adding any benefit to the farm, so you harvest your normal rate. 

## Harvesting
You start with the rate of 1 potato/second. To upgrade your harvest, you have to get 50 of your harvest to fill a potato bag, which you can then exchange for a magic potato. That being then 2 potatoes/second.

Example:
• Player starts with 1 potato/second, the player then needs 50 potatoes to get another magic potato.
• Player now has a harvest of 2 potatoes/second, he now needs 100 potatoes to get the third one. 

• A player has a harvest of 57 potatoes/second, meaning he needs 2850 potatoes to reach the next magic potato. But the player has a production rate of 100%, this is due to his workers being satisfied and happy. This now doubles his harvest, meaning he is on 114 potatoes/second. Meaning the player has to wait 25 seconds to reach the next milestone.
